# QuantumGenePulse
Welcome to QuantumGenePulse, where quantum computing meets genomics! This repository contains the code and resources for a project that explores the use of quantum computing techniques to analyze and process genetic information. Our goal is to develop innovative algorithms that can efficiently match gene sequences and contribute to advancements in the field of genomics.

Features:
- Implement a quantum algorithm for genetic sequence matching.
- Use AWS Braket's TN1 simulator for quantum circuit simulations.
- Compare the performance of quantum algorithms with classical methods for gene sequence analysis.
Getting Started:
To get started with QuantumGenePulse, clone the repository and follow the installation instructions in the README.md file. You can explore the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts to understand the implementation of quantum algorithms for genomics.

Contributing:
We welcome contributions from the community! If you're interested in quantum computing, genomics, or both, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests with your enhancements or bug fixes.
